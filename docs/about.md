### About the RPG Red List

I came across a list of the most inclusive tabletop roleplaying games but I had some issues with their implementation. The RPG Red List is an open-source list of the most inclusive roleplaying games and where to find them.

You can request to have your game or a game you know of to the list using this Google Form:

You can also contribute to the [github repository](https://github.com/ImagineItBetter/rpgredlist). 

This list is brought to you by [Absolute Tabletop](https://absolutetabletop.com)
