# The RPG Red List

I came across a list of the most inclusive tabletop roleplaying games but I had some issues with their implementation. The RPG Red List is an open-source list of the most inclusive roleplaying games and where to find them.

This is an open source list that works to compile roleplaying games that include inclusive themes.
