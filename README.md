# The RPG Red List

I came across a list of the most inclusive tabletop roleplaying games but I had some issues with their implementation. The RPG Red List is an open-source list of the most inclusive roleplaying games and where to find them.

This is an open source list that works to compile roleplaying games that include inclusive themes. 

Here is the link to the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/9nRb7tLrvJyqqWWe7) to submit your own, or create a pull request.

## How can I help?

You can check out the [issues page](https://github.com/ImagineItBetter/rpgredlist/issues) for a list of existing, simple ways to contribute to the list or the project itself. If you have an idea for the project, feel free to bring up an issue or submit a finished pull request for review.

## Who decides what goes on the list?

The list this project started with was created as a place to start, but is no means meant to be exhaustive. The Red List is an open source list, curated by those that wish to collaborate on curating it. Anyone that has an opinion about what should or should not be on the list is encouraged to voice that opinion. In this way the criteria of the list will be decided only by those products on the list.

If there is contention over a product on the list, feel free to raise issues to discuss.
